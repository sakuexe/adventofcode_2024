## Language

I chose to use Golang, since I want to learn to use it more. I really liked using
it while creating [Raino - Discord bot](https://github.com/sakuexe/go-raino),
but I haven't had the possibility to use the language much since then, due to
using a lot of C# in school and Javascript at work.
